# ImageCaptionGenerator
This is an image caption generating model that uses Keras' deep learning modules to create an image description generator that takes a photo as an input and outputs a text description of the image. This model was trained using [How to Develop a Deep Learning Photo Caption Generator from Scratch](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/) as a reference.
